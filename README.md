## üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Description
The main purpose of this Project was to create a command-line application that accepts user input using Node.js and npm and generates a README file for the repository. Basically, user will be given a set of questions on the command line and based on the answeres, a README file will be generated. During the learning process we've discovered how to run some code using node command. To build the code fs, path and inquirer npm packages were used. 

## Installation
No installation needed however in order to run this project Node.js and npm packages provided must be installed.

## Usage
To get started with this command-line application user has to be familiar with Node.js. After typing node index.js command in the terminal the user will get questions to answer one by one. Usually user has to type something, but for the License it's a choise from the list. If answering correctly to all of the questions the function in the end will generate the README, if not user will get an error.
